## What is Opus Vitea

The term "opus vitea" would most commonly be translated as "working draft" in English.  

A **_transliteration_** of "opus vitea" might be something like: "work, still on the vine"; more loosely: "a creation in process".  As a landing page for my unofficial presence on the web, I like this latter translation quite a bit.

## Who is this character anyway?

I'm honestly not sure of how much information to expose in plain text here.  This particular site is meant to be a creative place, and I can easily imagine saying or posting things that may cause offense, in fact I'm somewhat mystified these days on what **won't** cause offense.  For right now I'll keep personal information on the "downlow", and only post professional information on other sites.

I have undergraduate degrees in both _Chemistry_ and _Computer Science_, and I have been capturing, visualizing, and analyzing scientific data in the pharmaceutical and oil-and-gas industries for most of my professional life. This site is **not** for that. It's for purely creative projects. 

Relatively recently, I indulged my wanderlust by traveling across the United States several times to gather material for an imagined writing side gig.

I wrote poetry, took photos and drew sketches as I traveled (examples in the blogs may soon be on this site).

Now I'm back in the real world wondering what ever gave me the idea that I could leave.  In any case, if you find something here that makes you happy, or sad, or furious, well, good.  That's what the world should do.  Welcome to snapshots of my journey.

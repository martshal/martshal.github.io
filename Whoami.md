# Who is this character anyway?

In the first iteration of this page I had my name right here, but I'm honestly not sure of how much information to expose in plain text here.  This site is meant to be a creative place, and I can easily imagine writing or posting things that may cause offense.

I have undergraduate degrees in both _Chemistry_ and _Computer Science_. I have been capturing, visualizing, and analyzing scientific data in the pharmaceutical and oil-and-gas industries for many decades. This site is **not** for that. It's for purely creative projects. 

Relatively recently, I indulged my wanderlust by traveling across the United States several times to gather material for an imagined writing side gig.

I wrote poetry, took photos and drew sketches as I traveled (examples in the blogs may soon be on this site).

Now I'm back in the real world wondering what ever gave me the idea that I could leave.  In any case, if you find something here that makes you happy, or sad, or furious, well, good.  That's what the world should do.  Welcome to snapshots of my journey.

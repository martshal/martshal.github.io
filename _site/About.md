## What is Opus Vitea

The term "opus vitea" would most commonly be translated as "working draft" in English.

A **_transliteration_** of "opus vitea" might be something like: "work, still on the vine"; more loosely: "a creation in process". As a landing page for my unofficial presence on the web, I like this latter translation quite a bit.
